# ♦♥ BLACKJACK ♠♣ 

Blackjack, formerly known as twenty-one, is the most widely played casino banking game in the world. It is a card game where the objective is to be dealt cards totaling a higher value than those of the dealer, up to but not exceeding 21. 

There is actually a theory that Blackjack is an invention by the Romans. The theory stands because Romans loved to gamble, but it is not confirmed. It is believed that Romans played this game with wooden blocks with different numbers painted on them, instead of paper cards.
